# MPCIS
Vehicle computer interface application.
This application is meant to be a retro-futuristic art and technology project. It will eventually run on a Raspberry Pi and 
output VGA to some type of commercial video monitor with softkeys that interact with the GPIO to cycle between functions.

Think: "Chrysler Uconnect in 1989"
